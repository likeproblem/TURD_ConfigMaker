# TURD_ConfigMaker

Im honestly lil bit lazy so read main.py, it has basic instructions ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Every file .txt is customizable,
* Default, DefaultMulti, Recolour, RecolourMulti, TextureSets are presets with variables in them, declared using ```$YOUR_VARIABLE_HERE$```
* paths.txt is well, everything what has to do with paths, so you can rename all those files and change it here :]
* config.txt is variable storage, with ```VARIABLE;PROMPT;DEFAULT``` structure, reminder no $$(little tip, you can use variables in variables! if declared before that variable, it doesn't change, but after it will account for that, but doesn't matters anyway since it will be changed in write pass)
* autodefault.txt is self explanotary

# HOWTO USE
Install latest python, open cmd inside folder, and type ```python main.py```
